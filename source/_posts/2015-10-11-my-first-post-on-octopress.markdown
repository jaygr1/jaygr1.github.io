"Last week we watched the cohort ahead of us give their final presentations.  One group used a minimax function in their game.  In this post I'll give a quick primer on minimax algorithms. 

Minimax algorithms can be used in decision theory, game theory or statistics for minimizing the possible loss of a worst case scenario. The theory origionated with zero-sum game theory, but has grown to broadly cover decision making in the presence of uncertainty.  

The algorithm is typically used in two-player games. A value is associated with each position or state of the game. Most implementations of a minimax algoritihm employ a game tree to help the computer evaluate each of its possible moves.  While flexible, this can quickly decrease become a large undertaking for complex situations.  

Critics of the minimax theory argue that it's not particularly useful because it must have a determined loss function and it uses the worst case to define the value of a procedure.
